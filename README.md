# Laboratory Exercise 
## Task
Create a new toolbox (set of functions) to support the basic transformations in the plane (translation, rotation, scale change, similarity transformation, affine transformation, & projective transformation).
Create a program that will read the data given in the file "Point_Data.txt" and apply all the transformations of the created toolbox printing the corresponding results and the parameters selected for each transformation on the command line. The choice of parameters for the execution of the program can be random.
## Toolbox Parameters
### Input Data:
-List of (x,y) plane coordinate pairs
-List of transformation parameters
###Output Data:
-List of transformed pairs of (x',y') planar coordinates

## Toolbox
Our toolbox will support the following transformations:

-Translation
-Rotation
-Scale change
-Similarity transformation
-Affine transformation
-Projective transformation

## Program
The program will read data from a file and apply all the transformations of the created toolbox. The program will print the corresponding results and the parameters selected for each transformation on the command line. The choice of parameters for the execution of the program can be random.
